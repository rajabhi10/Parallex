      <h2>Cricket</h2>
      <p>
        Cricket is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players each.
        It is a bat-and-ball game played on a roughly oval grass field, in the
        centre of which is a flat strip of ground 20.12 m (22 yards) long,
        called a pitch. At each end of the pitch is a set of wooden stumps,
        called a wicket. Note that, rather confusingly, the pitch itself is also
        often referred to as the wicket. A player from the fielding team (the
        bowler) propels a hard, fist-sized cork-centred leather ball from one
        wicket towards the other. The ball usually bounces once before reaching
        a player from the opposing team (the batsman), who defends the wicket
        from the ball with a wooden cricket bat. The batsman may then run
        between the wickets, exchanging ends with another batsman (the
        "non-striker"), who has been standing in an inactive role near the
        bowler's wicket, to score runs. The remainder of the bowlers' team stand
        in various positions around the oval as fielders.

      <h2>Football</h2>
      <p>
        Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
        kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally
        means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is
        used. Sports commonly called football include association football
        (known as soccer in North America, Ireland and Australia); gridiron
        football (specifically American football or Canadian football);
        Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic
        football.[1] These various forms of football share to varying extents
        common origins and are known as "football codes".

      <h2>Badminton</h2>
      <p>
        Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock
        across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most
        common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and
        "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a
        casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played
        on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the
        shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the other team's half
        of the court. Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it
        passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor
        or ground, or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge,
        or (in their absence) the opposing side.The shuttlecock is a feathered
        or (in informal matches) plastic projectile that flies differently from
        the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create
        much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly.
        Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls in other
        racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its
        distinctive nature.
